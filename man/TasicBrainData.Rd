\title{Obtain the Tasic brain data}
\usage{
TasicBrainData()
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object.
}
\description{
Download and cache the Tasic brain single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset from ExperimentHub,
returning a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object for further use.
}
\details{
This function provides the brain scRNA-seq data from Tasic et al. (2015)
in the form of a \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object with a single matrix of read counts.

Column metadata is provided in the same form as supplied in GSE71585.
This contains information such as the reporter gene expressed in each cell, the mouse line, dissection type and so on.

Rows corresponding to spike-in transcripts are labelled with the \code{\link{isSpike}} function.
Note that some of the spike-in rows have \code{NA} observations for some (but not all) cells.

The last 9 columns (containing \code{_CTX_} in their names) correspond to no-cell control libraries.
