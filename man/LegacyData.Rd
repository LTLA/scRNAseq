\title{Reprocessed single-cell data sets}
\usage{
LegacyAllenData()

LegacyTh2Data()

LegacyFluidigmData()
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object containing one or more expression matrices,
column metadata and (possibly) spike-in information.
}
\description{
Obtain the reprocessed count matrices for three publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets.
Raw sequencing data were downloaded from NCBI's SRA or from EBI's ArrayExpress,
aligned to the relevant genome build and used to quantify gene expression.
}
\details{
\code{LegacyFluidigmData} returns a dataset of 65 cells from Pollen et al. (2014), 
each sequenced at high and low coverage (SRA accession SRP041736).

\code{LegacyTh2Data} returns a dataset of 96 T helper cells from Mahata et al. (2014),
obtained from ArrayExpress accession E-MTAB-2512.
This will contain spike-in information labelled with \code{\link{isSpike}}.

\code{LegacyAllenData} return a dataset of 379 cells from Tasic et al. (2016).
This is a re-processed subset of the data from \code{\link{TasicBrainData}},
It also contains spike-in information labelled with \code{\link{isSpike}}.

\section{Pre-processing details}{

FASTQ files were either obtained directly from ArrayExpress, 
or converted from SRA files (downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive) using the SRA Toolkit.

Reads were aligned with TopHat (v. 2.0.11) to the appropriate reference genome (GRCh38 for human samples, GRCm38 for mouse). 
RefSeq mouse gene annotation (GCF_000001635.23_GRCm38.p3) was downloaded from NCBI on Dec. 28, 2014. 
RefSeq human gene annotation (GCF_000001405.28) was downloaded from NCBI on Jun. 22, 2015.

featureCounts (v. 1.4.6-p3) was used to compute gene-level read counts.
Cufflinks (v. 2.2.0) was used to compute gene-leve FPKMs.
Reads were also mapped to the transcriptome using RSEM (v. 1.2.19) to compute read counts and TPM's.

FastQC (v. 0.10.1) and Picard (v. 1.128) were used to compute sample quality control (QC) metrics. 
However, no filtering on the QC metrics has been performed for any dataset.
