\title{Obtain the Nestorowa HSC data}
\usage{
NestorowaHSCData(remove.htseq = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{remove.htseq}{Logical scalar indicating whether HT-seq alignment statistics should be removed.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object with a single matrix of read counts.
}
\description{
Obtain the mouse haematopoietic stem cell single-cell RNA-seq data from Nestorowa et al. (2015).
}
\details{
Rows corresponding to HT-seq's alignment statistics are removed by default.
These can be retained by setting \code{remove.htseq=FALSE}.

Column metadata includes the cell type mapping, as described on the website (see References),
and the FACS expression levels of selected markers.
Note that these are stored as nested matrices within the \code{\link{colData}}.

Diffusion map components are provided as the \code{"diffusion"} entry in the \code{\link{reducedDims}}.

Counts for ERCC spike-ins are stored in the \code{"ERCC"} entry in the \code{\link{altExps}}.

All data are downloaded from ExperimentHub and cached for local re-use.
Specific resources can be retrieved by searching for \code{scRNAseq/nestorowa-hsc}.
