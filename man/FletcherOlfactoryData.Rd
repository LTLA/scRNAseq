\title{Obtain the Fletcher Olfactory data}
\usage{
FletcherOlfactoryData(filtered = TRUE, ensembl = FALSE, location = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filtered}{Logical scalar indicating whether to filter out cells that
were not used by the authors.}

\item{ensembl}{Logical scalar indicating whether the output row names should
contain Ensembl identifiers.}

\item{location}{Logical scalar indicating whether genomic coordinates should
be returned.}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{SingleCellExperiment} object with a single matrix of
  read counts.
}
\description{
Obtain the mouse olfactory epithelial HBC stem cell differentiation dataset
from Fletcher et al. (2017).
}
\details{
Column metadata is scraped from GEO, using both the author-supplied
"phenoData" per-cell annotations and the author-supplied "protocolData"
per-cell annotations. The former includes information about the animals and
the instruments, while the latter contains QC statistics.

We also included the clustering results from the authors' analysis.

If \code{filtered=TRUE}, only the cells used by the authors in their cluster
analysis are returned. Otherwise, the cells not used by the authors will have
NA in the clustering columns of the \code{\link{colData}}.

If \code{ensembl=TRUE}, the gene symbols are converted to Ensembl IDs in the
row names of the output object. Rows with missing Ensembl IDs are discarded,
and only the first occurrence of duplicated IDs is retained.

If \code{location=TRUE}, the coordinates of the Ensembl gene models are
stored in the \code{\link{rowRanges}} of the output.

All data are downloaded from ExperimentHub and cached for local re-use.
Specific resources can be retrieved by searching for
\code{scRNAseq/fletcher-olfactory}.
